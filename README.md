Welcome to Audiobook Tracker! 



The idea behind this project is simple! It's a companion for you to use when listening to your favorite Audiobooks. 

I listen to Audiobooks often, and as one does, my mind will sometimes stray while I'm listening. When my attention isn't fully focused, I tend to forget things in the story. Other times characters names may sound similar and I'll confuse them ,especially when the story is starting! That is why I created ABT. 



ABT is meant to help you make note of the litte details and things you want to remember for future reference in the book you're listening to.  



ABT is simple. You will input the title of the book you are listening to, the chapter you're on, the minute mark (if you so desire), the characters that were introduced up to that point (only if you want to make note of them or they seem of greater significance), and finally, you'll have the opportunity to enter notes. This is for any details, quotes, or other things about the book that you want to remember in the future. The possibilites are as vast as your imagination! :) 



I hope you enjoy! Happy listening!
